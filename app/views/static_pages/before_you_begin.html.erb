                        We are a small staff and since the COVID shutdown, we are often
                        working remotely. That means we have to take three extra steps to get
                        the job done. We process thousands of applications getting 2-3 million
                        dollars each year back out into the community in the form of heating
                        assistance.

                        You know what we CANNOT PROCESS? An INCOMPLETE APPLICATION.
                        That means we go onto the next one and try to get back to those in our
                        spare time. The problem is we only have spare time when we are out of
                        funds. If we are out of funds, then we simply cannot help.
