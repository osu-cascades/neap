      We are a small staff and since the COVID shutdown, we are often
      working remotely. That means we have to take three extra steps to get
      the job done. We process thousands of applications getting 2-3 million
      dollars each year back out into the community in the form of heating
      assistance.

    <li style="margin-top:1.25em; margin-bottom:1.25em">
      You know what we CANNOT PROCESS? An INCOMPLETE APPLICATION.
      That means we go onto the next one and try to get back to those in our
      spare time. The problem is we only have spare time when we are out of
      funds. If we are out of funds, then we simply cannot help.
