# NeighborImpact Energy Assistance Program

TODO: brief description

## Expectations

This is a Rails 5.x app with Ruby \~2.7, PostgreSQL, and AWS for storage.

After cloning this repository and `cd`ing into it, get up and running with:

`bundle install`
`rails db:setup`
`rails s`

## Development

There are a few steps to get up and running in development.

### Customize `.env`

* `DATABASE_URL_DEV`
* `DATABASE_URL_TEST`
* `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
* `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`

See _.env.example_ for a complete list of expected environment variables.

### TODO

## Testing

This app is using minitest / Rails default tests. Run the suite with:

`rails test`

Note: There is a _Guardfile_ should you wish to use guard.

## Production

There is a staging and production environment hosted by Heroku.

```
heroku git:remote -a nieap-staging
git remote rename heroku staging
heroku git:remote -a nieap
git remote rename heroku production
```

By renaming the remotes, you can then deploy with

```
git push staging
git push production
```

Configure env vars in staging and production:

* `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
* `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`
* `AWS_S3_KEY`
* `AWS_S3_SECRET`
* `AWS_REGION`
* `AWS_S3_BUCKET`

Note: See _.env.example_ for a complete list of expected environment
variables that need set in both staging & production environments.
